I'll implement task 12 to create the backend CI/CD pipeline automation. Let me start by updating the task status and then examining the current backend structure to understand what needs to be implemented.

Task: 12. Create backend CI/CD pipeline automation from 
tasks.md
Status: In Progress
Let me examine the current backend structure to understand the project setup:

Read file(s)

package.json

Dockerfile

.env.example
Now let me check if there's already a GitHub Actions directory and examine the deployment scripts:

Error(s) while searching workspace
Checking if GitHub Actions workflows already exist
Read file(s)

deploy.sh

destroy.sh

DEPLOYMENT.md
Now let me check the Jest configuration to understand the testing setup:

Read file(s)

jest.config.js
Perfect! Now I have a good understanding of the backend structure. Let me create the GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline. I'll create the workflow files and any necessary supporting files.

Created

ci-cd.yml


Now let me create a separate workflow for manual rollback operations:

Created

rollback.yml


Now let me create a workflow for dependency updates and security scanning:

Created

security-scan.yml


Now let me create a smoke test script that will be used in the CI/CD pipeline:

Created

smoke.test.ts


Now let me add the smoke test script to package.json:

Accepted edits to

package.json


Now let me create environment-specific Terraform variable files that are referenced in the CI/CD pipeline:

Created

dev.tfvars.example


Created

staging.tfvars.example


Created

prod.tfvars.example


Now let me create a GitHub Actions workflow for infrastructure validation:

Created

terraform-validate.yml


Now let me create a comprehensive README for the CI/CD setup:

Created

README.md


Now let me create a script to help developers set up the CI/CD pipeline:

Created

setup-cicd.sh


Command
chmod +x backend/scripts/setup-cicd.sh
VinilP-MAC:WordWise vinilp$ 
Now let me create a GitHub Actions workflow for monitoring the pipeline health:

Created

pipeline-health.yml


Finally, let me update the task status to completed:

Task: 12. Create backend CI/CD pipeline automation from 
tasks.md
Status: Completed
Perfect! I have successfully implemented task 12 - "Create backend CI/CD pipeline automation". Here's a comprehensive summary of what was implemented:

‚úÖ Task 12 Complete: Backend CI/CD Pipeline Automation
üöÄ Main CI/CD Pipeline (ci-cd.yml)
Automated testing pipeline with linting, unit tests, integration tests, and security scanning
80% code coverage threshold enforcement that fails builds below the requirement
Multi-environment deployment to development, staging, and production
Docker image building and pushing to Amazon ECR with automated tagging
Infrastructure deployment using Terraform with environment-specific configurations
Database migrations executed automatically during deployment
Health checks and smoke tests for deployment verification
Automatic rollback on production deployment failures
üîÑ Rollback Mechanisms (rollback.yml)
Manual rollback workflow with safety confirmations
Multiple rollback types: previous version, specific version, database restore
Pre-rollback backups for safety
Production-specific safeguards requiring additional confirmation
Health verification after rollback completion
üîí Security & Monitoring
Daily security scanning (security-scan.yml) with npm audit, Snyk, and Trivy
License compliance checking to prevent prohibited licenses
Automated dependency updates with PR creation for safe updates
Container security scanning with SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab
