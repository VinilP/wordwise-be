5. WHEN a user updates their review THEN the API SHALL save the changes and update the timestamp
6. WHEN a user deletes their review THEN the API SHALL remove it from the database and update book ratings
7. WHEN a user attempts to review the same book twice THEN the API SHALL update their existing review instead of creating a duplicate

### Requirement 4: Rating Aggregation System

**User Story:** As a system component, I want automatic rating aggregation, so that book ratings are always accurate and up-to-date.

2. WHEN a review is updated THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate the book's average rating
3. WHEN a review is deleted THEN the system SHALL automatically recalculate the book's average rating
4. WHEN a book has no reviews THEN the API SHALL return null for rating instead of zero
5. WHEN returning average ratings THEN the API SHALL return ratings rounded to one decimal place
6. WHEN returning average ratings THEN the API SHALL include the total number of reviews alongside the average

### Requirement 5: User Profile Management API

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I need user profile and favorites APIs, so that users can manage their profiles and track reading activity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend requests user profile THEN the API SHALL return name, email, and join date
2. WHEN the frontend requests user reviews THEN the API SHALL return a list of all reviews the user has written
3. WHEN the frontend requests user favorites THEN the API SHALL return the user's favorite books list
4. WHEN a user adds a book to favorites THEN the API SHALL save the relationship and return success
5. WHEN a user removes a book from favorites THEN the API SHALL delete the relationship and return success
6. WHEN the frontend requests review history THEN the API SHALL return book title, rating, review text, and date

### Requirement 6: AI-Powered Book Recommendations API

**User Story:** As a frontend application, I need recommendation APIs, so that users can receive personalized book recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has written at least 1 review THEN the API SHALL provide personalized recommendations

3. WHEN returning recommendations THEN the API SHALL include recommended books with explanation of why they were recommended
4. WHEN processing recommendations THEN the system SHALL consider user's favorite genres, highly-rated books, and review text sentiment
5. WHEN the AI service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to genre-based recommendations
6. WHEN a user has insufficient review history THEN the API SHALL return popular books in trending genres with appropriate messaging

### Requirement 7: Scalable Backend Architecture
